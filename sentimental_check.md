# Problem Statement

SentiMENTAL offers a unique perspective on personal relationship analysis, providing personal insight and sentiment analytics that contribute to a growing repository of de-identified SMS data. The repository of training data would eventually be utilized by researchers in a potential classification task for identification of mental health disorders. The draw of submitting SMS data comes from access to individual relationship analytics (response rate to/from friends, topics most discussed, average mood during the day), thus, layout of the application will come in tiers, involving the user to label their own training instances (is this text happy? sad? angry? etc). The more participatory a user decides to be, the more access to relationship analysis and sentiment analysis conclusions will be offered. For researchers, this eventually will result in a rich body of labeled text for classification tasks.
